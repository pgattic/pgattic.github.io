# About Me

![Baby Preston on the computer](/baby-programmer/mpv-shot0004.jpg)

I am Preston Corless. I like to code, do gymnastics, and play the guitar!

I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I graduated from the International Academy of Macomb in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡» El Salvador.

I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. I have learned HTML5 + JavaScript and Python since then, and spent a lot of time experimenting in other languages, too!

I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [BYU-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/) in Spring 2025, and started my Master's degree at [BYU](https://byu.edu) in September 2025.

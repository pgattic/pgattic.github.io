# Hello! I'm Preston!

<img alt="Fishing" src="/PXL_20250519_235925485.MP.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 360px; object-fit:cover">

I code, do gymnastics, play the guitar, and do a little fishing!

I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I graduated from the International Academy of Macomb in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡» El Salvador.

I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. My journey has taken me through many technologies, like Linux, JavaScript, C#, Kotlin, and eventually Rust!

I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [BYU-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/) in Spring 2025, and started my Master's degree at [BYU](https://byu.edu) in September 2025.

| <img src="/svg/html5-logo.svg" alt="HTML5 Logo" height="32"> | I taught myself <b style="color:#E44D26">HTML</b> throughout middle school and high school, but didn't do much with it until I learned JavaScript. I also have taken courses in college on the language. | [Gamedev Springboard](https://github.com/pgattic/gamedev-springboard), [HTML5 Golf](https://github.com/pgattic/html5-golf) |
| <img src="/svg/asm.svg" alt="ASM Logo" height="32"> | I taught myself <b style="color:#888">6502 Assembly</b> while in middle school, and I used it to make games for the NES, a game console from the '80s! | [Simplistic](https://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/111/), [Super Rex Dash](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4298/) |
| <img src="/svg/javascript-logo.svg" alt="JavaScript Logo" height="32"> | I taught myself <b style="color:#d4bc08">JavaScript</b> in the summer of 2019 to get into web and game development. I quickly found a liking for it, and I used it for a long time as my language of choice! | [Multiplayer Snake](https://github.com/pgattic/multiplayer-snake), [Platformer](https://github.com/pgattic/platformer), [Raycaster](https://github.com/pgattic/raycaster-demo), [Snake Evolved](https://github.com/pgattic/snake-evolved), [Yeet Ball](https://github.com/pgattic/yeetball) |
| <img src="/svg/python-logo.svg" alt="Python Logo" height="32"> | I took up <b style="color:#3776AB">Python</b> at first on my own, but also my classes at BYU-Idaho gave me some academic experience in the language as well! | [Home Care Analysis](https://github.com/pgattic/hackathon-2022), [Py-Raycaster](https://github.com/pgattic/py-raycaster) |
| <img src="/svg/c-logo.svg" alt="C Logo" height="32"> | I started learning <b style="color:#0071c7">C</b> for a Computer Systems course, but have since taken other courses at school in the language! I have also continued to personally refine my knowledge of it while developing personal projects. | [BrainFetch](https://github.com/pgattic/brainfetch), [Killer Boxes](https://github.com/Jwesterner/killer_boxes) |
| <img src="/svg/mysql-logo.svg" alt="SQL Logo" height="32"> | I learned <b style="color:#E48E00">SQL</b> as part of my Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho in the Fall of 2022, and later used <b style="color:#0482C4">SQLite</b> in a mobile development job! |  |
| <img src="/svg/kotlin-logo.svg" alt="Kotlin Logo" height="32"> | I learned <b style="color:#806EE3">Kotlin</b> for an internship in mobile app development during the winter of 2023! I really loved how it introduced me to object-oriented programming. |  |
| <img src="/svg/clojure-logo.svg" alt="Clojure Logo" height="32"> | I learned <b style="color:#56be08">Clojure</b> through my Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho, as part of my functional programming certificate. Learning Clojure and exploring the code-as-data paradigm piqued my interest in learning functional programming! |  |
| <img src="/svg/c-sharp-logo.svg" alt="C# Logo" height="32"> | I learned <b style="color:#9F35BA">C#</b> through my Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho. I built off of the knowledge I gained while learning Kotlin in order to improve my mastery of the language. |  |
| <img src="/svg/erlang-logo.svg" alt="Erlang Logo" height="32"> | I learned <b style="color:#a90533">Erlang</b> through my Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho. To up my mastery of Erlang, I rewrote some of my side projects in it. | [V2X](https://github.com/pgattic/v2x-erl) |
| <img src="/svg/dart-logo.svg" alt="Dart Logo" height="32"> | My team learned <b style="color:#29B6F6">Flutter</b> and <b style="color:#29B6F6">Dart</b> for [BYU-Idaho's Fall 2023 Hackathon](https://byuihack.org) for our submission, which took first place in its category! | [Neighborhood Nexus](https://github.com/pgattic/neighbor_nexus) |
| <img src="/svg/rust-logo.svg" alt="Rust Logo" height="32"> | I taught myself <b style="color:#f74c00">Rust</b> for the reference implementation of my [Cairn project](https://github.com/pgattic/cairn)'s code interpreter. I chose Rust because I wanted to learn more about good memory management practices and because the functional programming ideology is something that I am personally very interested in. | [Cairn](https://github.com/pgattic/cairn) |

*Brief presentation of the project*

The Hackathon award ceremony was today! Our team all showed up, and we set up a little stand like the rest of the teams and demonstrated our project. Then, the moment came. They began to announce the winners of the Hackathon.

*Victorious!*

And guess what? We WON. We won the whole event, took first place, against 18 groups. And the judges said it was by a landslide! I could not believe it. I didn't think it was possible.

I was very proud to have won the competiton. I know our hard work paid off! The hackathon was so fun, and I think I grew a lot! Even if we hadn't won, it still would go down as a highlight of my year! I think I'll compete in another one sometime!

*Jack and I with the completed project*

For a Computer Systems course final, Jack (a teammate from the hackathon) and I put our heads together and blew the assignment out of the water! We spent a good couple of days putting this little game together, and it was really fun! We decided to call it "Killer Boxes". You'd have to play it to understand.

*Killer Boxes, all wired up!*

At the start of the project, I figured I knew more or less how C's syntax worked, but I had some adjusting to do. No more optional semicolons or dynamically-sized arrays!

I learned a lot about C language even though it was such a small project. I am excited about it, since I know C will be useful if I ever want to get into low-level computing!

The code for the game is now proudly available on its Git repo.

				<p>I am Preston Corless. I like to code üë®‚Äçüíª, do gymnastics ü§∏, and play the guitar üé∏! But not all at the same time! üòâ</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iamacomb.org/" target="_blank">International Academy of Macomb</a> in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in üá∏üáª El Salvador, and I am currently attending <a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a>, majoring in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. I have learned HTML5 + JavaScript and Python since then, and spent a lot of time experimenting in other languages, too!</p>
				<p>I am from Detroit, Michigan, currently residing in Rexburg, Idaho. I have recently been involved in some of BYU-Idaho's software-related events and organizations, including taking first place in its Fall 2022 Hackathon.</p>

					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/HTML5-logo.svg" alt="HTML5 Logo"><span><b>HTML5:</b> I taught myself HTML throughout middle school and highschool, but didn't do much with it until I learned JavaScript. I also have taken courses in college on the language.</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/asm.svg" alt="ASM Logo"><span><b>6502 Assembly:</b> I taught myself assembly for the 6502 Processor while in middle school, and I used it to make games for the NES, a game console from the '80s!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/JavaScript-logo.svg" alt="JavaScript Logo"><span><b>JavaScript:</b> I taught myself JavaScript in the summer of 2019 to get into web and game development. I quickly found a liking for it, and I now use it as my language of choice!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/Python-logo.svg" alt="Python Logo"><span><b>Python:</b> I took up Python at first on my own, but also my classes at BYU-Idaho gave me some academic experience in the language as well!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/c-logo.svg" alt="C Logo"><span><b>C:</b> I started learning C for a Computer Systems course, but have since taken other courses at school in the language! I have also continued to personally refine my knowledge of it while developing personal projects.</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/mysql-logo.svg" alt="SQL Logo"><span><b>SQL:</b> I learned SQL as part of my major at BYU-Idaho in the Fall of 2022, and have used it in a mobile app development job!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/kotlin-logo.svg" alt="Kotlin Logo"><span><b>Kotlin:</b> I learned Kotlin for an internship in mobile app development during the winter of 2023! Although not my language of choice, I really loved how it introduced me to object-oriented programming.</span></div>

					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/linux-logo.svg" alt="Tux"><span><b>Linux:</b> I have many consecutive years of using Ubuntu-based distributions of Linux as my daily OS of choice on my computers, and I love it!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/git-logo.svg" alt="Git Logo"><span><b>Git:</b> I have gotten well-acquainted with how Git works and its features as I learned more about software development.</span></div>

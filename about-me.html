				<h1>About Me</h1><img src="img/me-cropped.png" id="profile">
				<p>I am Preston Corless. I like to code 👨‍💻, do gymnastics 🤸, and play the guitar 🎸! But not all at the same time! 😉</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iamacomb.org/" target="_blank">International Academy of Macomb</a> in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in 🇸🇻 El Salvador, and I am currently attending <a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a>, majoring in Computer Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. I have learned HTML5 + JavaScript and Python since then, and spent a lot of time experimenting in other languages, too!</p>
				<p>I am from Detroit, Michigan, currently residing in Rexburg, Idaho.</p>

					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/asm.svg"><span><b>6502 Assembly:</b> I decided to learn assembly for the 6502 Processor during middle school, and I used it to make games for the NES, a game console from the '80s!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/JavaScript-logo.svg"><span><b>JavaScript:</b> In the summer of 2019, I decided to begin learning modern programming languages. I soon found a liking for JavaScript, and I now use it as my language of choice!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/Python-logo.svg"><span><b>Python:</b> I have more recently taken up Python, at first on my own, but now through classes at BYU-Idaho!</span></div>

					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/Linux-logo.svg"><span><b>Linux:</b> I have many consecutive years of using Ubuntu-based distributions of Linux as my daily OS of choice on my computers, and I love it!</span></div>
					<div class="bubble"><img src="svg/Git-logo.svg"><span><b>Git:</b> I have gotten well-acquainted with how Git works and its features as I learned more about software development. </span></div>

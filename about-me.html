				<p>I am Preston Corless. I like to code üë®‚Äçüíª, do gymnastics ü§∏, and play the guitar üé∏! But not all at the same time! üòâ</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iamacomb.org/" target="_blank">International Academy of Macomb</a> in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in üá∏üáª El Salvador, and I am currently attending <a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a>, majoring in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. I have learned HTML5 + JavaScript and Python since then, and spent a lot of time experimenting in other languages, too!</p>
				<p>I am from Detroit, Michigan, currently residing in Rexburg, Idaho. I have recently been involved in some of BYU-Idaho's software-related events and organizations, including taking first place in its Fall 2022 Hackathon.</p>
